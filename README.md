Human resources is in charge of arranging interviews, coordinating hiring efforts, and onboarding new employees. They're also in charge of making sure all paperwork involved with hiring someone is filled out and making sure that everything from the first day to each subsequent day is navigated successfully.  

_Hey, Fallas!_
_I'm happy to share with you a simple dashboard I built to analyze the human resource staff dashboard of an organization in two countries: India and New Zealand.
The dashboard seeks to analyze the comparison staff in the two countries in terms of gender, headcount by departments, and growth rate trend of the organization over time. This work was done completely in Microsoft Office Excel 365 version._
